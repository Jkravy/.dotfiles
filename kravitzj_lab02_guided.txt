In order to complete this lab, the vim text editor was opened using the vim vim.rc command and then syntax/grammatical rules were added. I then saved the file and reopened it to type this. I ran into a problem orignally trying to open the vim file as I opened it on a previous terminal I had already closed. This caused there to already be a vim open and I had to force quit the old one in order to open the new vim.
